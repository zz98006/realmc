Minecraft: Web Edition is an AOT-compiled adaptation of Mojang’s Minecraft 1.5.3, designed to run in an HTML5/JavaScript environment using MOJANG-TEE to emulate a desktop Java runtime. This allows the full Minecraft experience to be played directly in modern web browsers without requiring a client download.
